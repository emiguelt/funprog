Notes/Exercises for learning Scala Language

## Neophyte's guide

* From: www.danielwestheide.com/scala/neophytes.html

## Play Framework

* From official documentation at www.playframework.com

### Play for Scala (book) - Notes about
* There is no enough information where to add functions/features to the example used along the book
* where to put the Global object? At the default package (found in playframework online documentation, not in book)
* Creating the database schema for Squeryl the `import org.squeryl.Table` is missing
* To use Squeryl with auto_increment it is necessary to add an evolution, that is not informed in the book
* Chapter 6 (templating) presents some basic conventions/syntax for templating in Play, but the example are pretty similar to the templates with products example, so it could be read quickly (or skipped), to continue with validatons.
